	<!-- Details -->
	<div class="container">
		<h3 id="cctv">CCTV - Closed Circuit Television Camera</h3>
		<p>CCTV cameras are counted by the camera unit. Cameras may or may
			not share a cabinet with other VDS systems. Multiple cameras at a
			single location will be counted as individual inventory units. The
			entire system may consist of mounting hardware, a dedicated pole to
			mount the camera, hardware to connect power and data, pullboxes,
			conduit, controller and cabinet to house the system.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="cms">CMS - Changeable Message Sign</h3>
		<p>Changeable message signs are counted by the sign panel. Systems
			will include the mounting hardware or structure, data and power
			connections, pullboxes, conduit, and the controller and cabinet.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="ems">EMS - Extinguishable Message Sign</h3>
		<p>Extinguishable message signs are counted by the sign panel.
			Systems will include the mounting hardware or structure, data and
			power connections, pullboxes, conduit, and the controller and
			cabinet.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="fb">FB - Flashing Beacon</h3>
		<p>Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) broadcasts road/ travel
			information to the motoring public. The HAR is supported by Flashing
			Beacons (FB) and a fixed sign. When the FB is on (flashing yellow
			lights) it draws drivers attention to the sign that displays the
			frequency to tune to hear pertinent road information.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="har">HAR - Highway Advisory Radio</h3>
		<p>Highway advisory radio stations are counted by the system. This
			includes the transmitter, antenna, pole, conduit, and controller
			cabinet.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="rm">RM - Ramp Meter</h3>
		<p>Ramp meters are counted at the cabinet level, similar to
			traffic monitoring stations. Ramp meter cabinets may also provide
			traffic monitoring adjacent to the ramp meter system, this is
			included as part of the ramp meter, not as a separate traffic
			monitoring station. Ramp meter systems may include multiple traffic
			monitoring functions, both on the ramp and adjacent lanes, metering
			signals, pullboxes, conduit, cabinet, and controllers.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="rwis">RWIS - Roadside Weather Information System</h3>
		<p>Roadside weather information systems (RWIS) are counted by the
			weather station. An RWIS may consist of multiple components to detect
			the local weather conditions, such as visibility sensors, cameras,
			anemometer , rain gauge, barometers, pavement surface probe and ice
			sensors. More or less sensors may be included, depending on the
			functions needed at the location. RWIS locations may include any
			necessary power, conduit, pull boxes, communication infrastructure,
			and controller cabinet.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="signal">Signal - Intersection Traffic Signal</h3>
		<p>Traffic signals are counted by the signalized intersection that
			uses the signals. Even if multiple complete signal systems exist at
			an intersection, only one unit is counted. Traffic signals include
			the pole structures, signals, foundations, conduit and wiring,
			service enclosures, pedestrian heads, and controller cabinets.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="vds">VDS - Vehicle Detection System</h3>
		<p>Vehicle detection system,also known as detector stations or
			traffic monitoring stations, or are counted at the cabinet level. Each
			cabinet may have multiple controllers, and each controller may detect
			traffic in multiple lanes. In the event that a cabinet also houses a
			controller used with a CMS or CCTV camera, it is still considered to
			be the traffic monitoring stationâ€™s cabinet for inventory purposes.
			The traffic monitoring station includes the cabinet and controllers,
			along with any hardware used for vehicle detection, such as inductive
			loops, radar, or piezometers.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="vcs">VCS - Vehicle Classification Station</h3>
		<p>Vehicle size classes are a way of classifying cars. The common
			North American parlance is word-based, while English-speaking
			European writers also use words to describe car sizes. In parts of
			Asia, segment letters are sometimes used.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="wim">WIM - Weigh In Motion</h3>
		<p>Weigh-in-motion or weighing in motion (WIM) devices are
			designed to capture and record axle weights and gross vehicle weights
			as vehicles drive over a measurement site. Unlike static scales, WIM
			systems are capable of measuring vehicles traveling at a reduced or
			normal traffic speed and do not require the vehicle to come to a
			stop. This makes the weighing process more efficient, and, in the
			case of commercial vehicles, allows for trucks under the weight limit
			to bypass static scales or inspection.</p>
